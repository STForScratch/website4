    <p>Back in 2022, ScratchTools acquired ScratchFormat.</p>

        <h1>About ScratchFormat</h1>
        <p>Like ScratchTools, ScratchFormat is an open source browser extension for Scratch. It allows you to format your comments across profiles, projects, and studios. You can make the text in your comments bold, underlined, and more using a basic syntax.</p>
        <h1>Why the change?</h1>
        <p>The newest version of ScratchFormat at the time had been created in early 2020, two years before ScratchTools started. It was no longer being maintained, and was scheduled to be removed from the Chrome Web Store because it hadn't been updated to Manifest v3. ScratchTools started right after Manifest v3 started being put into use, so ScratchTools had started using the new version immediately.</p>
        <p>ScratchFormat seemed like a helpful extension and, at the time, it had more users than ScratchTools. ScratchTools reached out to the developers of the extension, one of which happened to be a ScratchTools developer, and eventually acquired the extension.</p>
        <h1>What this looks like</h1>
        <p>Now, there's a feature in ScratchTools called <i>ScratchFormat</i> that includes all the same features as the original extension, with some removed due to security issues. ScratchTools was careful with the acquisition to make sure that all included code was safe for the extension and for the users.</p>
        <p>The original extension has removed the basic functionality, and added a link to ScratchTools in its popup, as well as an explanation of the changes. On profile pages with ScratchFormat installed, there's a banner explaining the changes and linking to ScratchTools.</p>
